# 🧪 Inferential Statistics Project

Applied inferential statistics techniques including hypothesis testing, ANOVA, and probability analysis on real-world datasets to derive actionable insights in sports injuries, manufacturing quality, stone hardness, and dental implants.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze diverse datasets using statistical inference techniques and deliver business recommendations by applying:

- Probability theory
- Z-test, T-test (One-sample & Two-sample)
- ANOVA (One-way and Two-way)
- Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test
- Confidence intervals and p-value-based decision-making

## 📊 Problem Domains Covered

1. **Sports Injury Probability Analysis**  
   - Computed conditional and joint probabilities of player injuries by position.

2. **Gunny Bag Strength Study**  
   - Evaluated the proportion of bags falling within acceptable strength limits using the normal distribution.

3. **Stone Printing Suitability**  
   - Assessed whether polished/unpolished stones meet the required Brinell Hardness Index via t-tests.

4. **Dental Implant Durability Study**  
   - Used One-way and Two-way ANOVA to measure effects of dentists, alloy types, and implant methods.
   - Performed Tukey HSD to pinpoint statistically significant groups.
