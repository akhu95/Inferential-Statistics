🧪 Inferential Statistics Project
This repository presents a comprehensive data analysis project conducted as part of the PGP Data Science program, applying core concepts of inferential statistics to real-world problems using Python.

📌 Project Objective
To explore statistical relationships and derive actionable insights using:

Probability Theory

Hypothesis Testing (Z-Test, T-Test)

ANOVA

Tukey’s HSD Test

Normal Distribution Analysis

🗂️ Problem Statements Covered
Sports Injury Analysis

Injury probability based on football player positions.

Conditional and joint probabilities.

Manufacturing Strength Analysis

Analyze breaking strength of gunny bags.

Calculate proportions under normal distribution curve.

Stone Printing Suitability Study

One-sample and two-sample T-tests on polished/unpolished stones.

Hypothesis validation against Brinell Hardness Index.

Dental Implant Hardness Study

One-way and Two-way ANOVA to test the impact of:

Dentist

Implant Method

Type of Alloy

Interaction effects

Tukey HSD for post-hoc analysis.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Statsmodels, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

Jupyter Notebook

ANOVA & hypothesis testing libraries

Visualization for statistical interpretation

📈 Key Learnings
Application of inferential statistics in quality control and medical research.

Understanding normality, variance assumptions, and their impact on test selection.

Data storytelling through statistical plots and confidence intervals.

Decision-making based on p-values and significance levels.
